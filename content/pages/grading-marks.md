Local Observations
------------------

We use standard proofreader marks, including the following:

| MArk | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Awk | Seems awkwardly put to me. |
| \[Circle with tail\] | Get rid of this. |
| Stet | Let it stand as it is. I changed my mind. 

We also use these personal marks:

| MArk | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| \[Check\] | This is what we wanted or a reasonable alternative or a nice point. Roughly equivalent to "amen." |
| ! | Particularly nice point. I wish I had thought of it. |
| ? | I don't understand this. |
| hmmm | Seems strange to me, albeit without a lot of thought. |
| X | I don't agree with this, but I agree that it is a matter of opinion. |
| XX | I really don't think this can be defended. Ask me about it if classroom discussion does not clarify why. |
| W | Weaker argument than expected. |
| S | Style objection. See [style guide]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/style-guide).
